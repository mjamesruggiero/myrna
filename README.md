Learning [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) by way of Clojure

## background

Trying to do more around NLP, and reading Mark Watson's [Practical Artificial Intelligence Programming With Clojure](https://leanpub.com/clojureai)
led me to spaCy. This project may use other libraries, but I'm having fun with this right now.

## what's with the name?

Named after Myrna Turner for no real reason.
